### Python Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

"+"	Addition	x + y	

"-"	Subtraction	x - y	

"*" Multiplication	x * y	

/	Division	x / y	

%	Modulus	x % y	

**	Exponentiation	x ** y	

//	Floor division	x // y

 

### Python Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

=	x = 5	x = 5	

+=	x += 3	x = x + 3	

-=	x -= 3	x = x - 3	

*=	x *= 3	x = x * 3	

/=	x /= 3	x = x / 3	

%=	x %= 3	x = x % 3	

//=	x //= 3	x = x // 3	

**=	x **= 3	x = x ** 3	

&=	x &= 3	x = x & 3	

|=	x |= 3	x = x | 3	

^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3	

>>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3	

<<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3	

:=	print(x := 3)	x = 3 print(x)
